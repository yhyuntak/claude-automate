## Context
Refined parallel execution strategy for agent delegation based on brainstorming session insights. Focused on adding principles-based guidance without over-prescriptive rules.

## Work Summary
- Brainstormed parallel execution strategy for exploration and implementation agents
- Evaluated tier selection autonomy (decided agents decide based on existing criteria)
- Added "병렬 실행" (Parallel Execution) section to agent-delegation.md
- Updated both global rules and project-specific rules with consistent content
- Committed changes as v0.14.0

## Problems & Solutions
- Complexity vs. guidance balance → Chose minimal principles-based approach to avoid over-specification while keeping agents autonomous

## Decisions
- **Parallel execution principle**: Exploration and implementation agents can run in parallel when no dependencies exist
- **No detailed tier rules**: Agents autonomously select appropriate tier (Haiku/Sonnet/Opus) based on task complexity
- **Documentation approach**: Keep principles minimal, let agent judgment prevail over prescriptive rules

## Next Session Suggestions
- Review session context file structure and frequency
- Evaluate parallel agent execution effectiveness in real projects
- Consider documenting common parallelization patterns as they emerge
