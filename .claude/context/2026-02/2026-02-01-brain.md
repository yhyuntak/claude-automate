# Session: 2026-02-01 프로젝트 뇌 시스템 설계

## Context
Transformed two feedback items (pattern-checker validation and /wrap improvements) into a comprehensive "프로젝트 뇌" (Project Brain) system concept. The goal is to create persistent knowledge across sessions within the Claude ecosystem.

## Work Summary
- Designed "프로젝트 뇌" system concept:
  - Central brain.md file at .claude/brain.md for persistent knowledge
  - Four core sections: Architecture, Patterns, Legacy, History
- Defined operational principles (8 key questions):
  - Free markdown format for flexibility
  - Brain updates embedded in /wrap command
  - Trust-based sync validation
  - Automatic responsibility assignment
- Abstracted core operations: Read → Analyze → Write cycle
- Created 6-task backlog structured across 3 phases:
  - Phase 1: Foundation (3 tasks - brain.md structure, start-work integration, wrap integration)
  - Phase 2: Enhancement (2 tasks - core operations, context optimization)
  - Phase 3: Advanced (1 task - agent sophistication)

## Problems & Solutions
- Open feedback (claude.md auto-update + LSP/code graph) → Deferred to post-Phase-2 implementation; needs deeper architecture understanding

## Decisions
- **brain.md format**: Free markdown (not strictly typed) for cognitive flexibility
- **Update mechanism**: Embed in /wrap rather than separate command
- **Sync validation**: Trust-based, not verification-heavy
- **Responsibility model**: Automatic through context passing
- **Development order**: Perfect core operations (Read/Analyze/Write) before agent implementation

## Incomplete/TODO
- [ ] phase1-001: Define brain.md structure and sections
- [ ] phase1-002: Integrate brain loading into /start-work command
- [ ] phase1-003: Integrate brain updating into /wrap command
- [ ] phase2-001: Improve core operations (Read/Analyze/Write)
- [ ] phase2-002: Optimize context management and passing
- [ ] phase3-001: Enhance multi-agent coordination with project brain

## Next Session Suggestions
1. Start phase1-001: Define the exact structure, sections, and format of brain.md file
2. Review backlog tasks to ensure acceptance criteria are clear
3. Begin implementation with /start-work brain loading (phase1-002)
