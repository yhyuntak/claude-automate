# Session: 2026-02-06

## Context
Improved brainstorm/planning skill role separation by integrating devil agent for requirement validation. Session focused on clarifying when each skill is used in the workflow and who performs validation at each phase.

## Work Summary
- Integrated devil agent into brainstorm skill for Phase 4.5 (requirement reality validation)
  - Added devil validation step to check feasibility before passing to planning
  - Ensures requirements are grounded in reality before detailed planning starts
- Refactored planning skill Phase 0 (from detailed validation to simple gate check)
  - Removed redundant Phase 0.5 (devil validation) from planning
  - Kept Phase 0 as pass-through gate to prevent rework
- Documented clear responsibility boundary: brainstorm validates requirements, planning validates plans
- Updated both skill files with refined phases and inputs/outputs

## Files Changed
- `/Users/yoohyuntak/workspace/claude-automate/skills/brainstorm/SKILL.md` (+36 lines)
- `/Users/yoohyuntak/workspace/claude-automate/skills/planning/SKILL.md` (-91/+56 lines)

## Decisions
- **Devil integration location**: Placed in brainstorm (Phase 4.5) rather than planning to catch infeasible requirements early
- **Planning Phase 0 simplification**: Converted from detailed validation to simple gate check to avoid duplicate validation work
- **Workflow boundary**: Brainstorm responsible for requirement validation, planning responsible for plan validation

## Problems & Solutions
None encountered. Changes were straightforward refactoring based on design principles.

## Pattern Checker Notes
- **Medium priority**: Document brainstorm/planning boundary in rules/ for future reference
- **Future task**: Create integrated devil documentation (skills/devil/references/INTEGRATION.md) for when multiple skills use devil

## Version
v0.17.0 → v0.18.0

## Incomplete/TODO
- [ ] Create documentation on brainstorm/planning responsibility boundaries (rules/)
- [ ] Create devil integration guide for multi-skill usage (skills/devil/references/INTEGRATION.md)
- [ ] Review if other skills should integrate devil validation

## Next Session Suggestions
1. Create rules/brainstorm-planning-boundary.md documenting when each skill is used
2. Update README.md to reflect v0.18.0 changes
3. Consider devil integration in other skills (if applicable)
4. Test brainstorm→planning workflow with devil validation
