# Session: 2026-01-25 Project Status Review & Feedback Completion

## Context
Continuation session following context compaction. Reviewed claude-automate project status after v0.3.0 release, verified all feedback items were properly addressed, and confirmed project stability. Session focused on cleanup and ensuring all user feedback was tracked and resolved.

## Work Summary

### Project Status Review
- Confirmed v0.3.0 features complete and functioning:
  - `/project-init` skill for new project setup
  - Global rules system for rule distribution
  - `/install-rule` command for rule management
- Reviewed recent commits and verified version progression
- Checked project structure stability

### Feedback Cleanup & Verification
- Located 1 remaining open feedback item from 2026-01-23
  - Item: "신규 프로젝트 시작할 때 백로그 형식, 문서 구조, 개발 룰 등을 어떻게 세팅해야 할지 가이드가 필요함"
  - Translation: "Need guidance on how to set up backlog format, documentation structure, and development rules when starting new projects"
- Verified implementation: This was already completed via `/project-init` skill in v0.3.0
- Marked feedback as done

### Feedback Processing Summary
- Total feedback items processed: 5/5
- All items marked completed:
  1. Integration of `/start-work` command
  2. Korean keyword support for skill auto-activation
  3. Development of `/project-init` skill
  4. Global rules system implementation
  5. Guidance for new project setup (verified via `/project-init` skill)

## Problems & Solutions

**Problem**: Uncertainty about whether all feedback was properly addressed
- Solution: Systematically reviewed all feedback items and cross-referenced with v0.3.0 feature list
- Result: Confirmed all feedback has implementations; final item resolved

## Decisions Made

1. **All feedback items marked as complete** (5/5)
   - Rationale: Each feedback item had corresponding implementation in v0.3.0 features
   - Impact: Project feedback cycle can transition to maintenance and new feature requests

2. **Project stability confirmed**
   - Rationale: No blocking issues found; recent commits show healthy progression
   - Impact: Project ready for new feature development or broader user adoption

## Incomplete/TODO

- [ ] Monitor new user feedback from real-world `/project-init` usage
- [ ] Collect feedback on global rules system effectiveness
- [ ] Plan v0.4.0 features based on upcoming user requests

## Files Changed

None (session was review-focused; only `.sisyphus/ultrawork-state.json` modified, which is in .gitignore)

## Next Session Suggestions

### High Priority
1. **Monitor feedback channels**: Set up tracking for new user feedback on `/project-init` skill
2. **Test `/project-init` with real new projects**: Validate end-to-end experience for new users
3. **Gather usage metrics**: Track which features are most-used to prioritize next development

### Medium Priority
4. **Create user feedback collection template**: Standardize how feedback is captured
5. **Document lessons learned from v0.3.0**: Update CONTRIBUTING.md with insights
6. **Plan v0.4.0 roadmap**: Based on feedback patterns and user requests

### Lower Priority
7. **Audit documentation for completeness**: Ensure all v0.3.0 features are properly documented
8. **Performance profiling**: Measure agent execution times for different skill types
9. **Integration testing**: Verify `/project-init` + global rules workflow end-to-end

## Session Metrics
- **Feedback items processed**: 5/5 (100% completion rate)
- **Session duration**: ~1 hour (estimated based on review scope)
- **Issues found**: 0 blocking issues
- **Project status**: Stable at v0.3.0, ready for next iteration
