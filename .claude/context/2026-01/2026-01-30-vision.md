# Session: 2026-01-30 Vision Plan Implementation

## Context

Implemented comprehensive vision restructuring for claude-automate project. Transitioned from ad-hoc agent collection to structured architecture with clear mission, principles, and phased roadmap. Established foundation documents (README, CLAUDE.md, backlogs) to guide future development.

## Work Summary

### Documentation
- Rewrote README.md with Korean-first vision structure
  - Added project mission, core values, architecture overview
  - Progressive disclosure: quick start → deeper sections
- Created README.en.md (English translation)
- Created CLAUDE.md (14-page principle document)
  - Project philosophy and development culture
  - Code without reading principle
  - Backlog/story writing standards
  - Pattern library and skill development guide

### Project Structure
- Established docs/backlogs/ folder structure (todo/doing/done)
- Created docs/backlogs/README.md with status dashboard
- Updated docs/references/README.md

### Phase 1 Backlog
Created three foundational tasks:
- phase1-001-parallel-review-agents.md
  - User Story: Developers want faster code reviews
  - Acceptance: Review 3+ files in parallel with specialized agents
- phase1-002-triage-workflow.md
  - User Story: Developers need workflow guidance
  - Acceptance: Triage requests into 4 workflow types
- phase1-003-review-learning.md
  - User Story: Developers want to learn patterns
  - Acceptance: Extract and organize learned skills

## Problems & Solutions

No blocking issues encountered. Structure validated through:
- Folder hierarchy consistency check
- File naming convention validation (phase{N}-{ID}-{slug})
- Template completeness verification

## Decisions

1. **Vision Focus: "코드를 보지 않고 개발하기"**
   - Rationale: Unique value proposition differentiating from standard code assistants
   - Drives architecture toward pattern-based, intelligent automation

2. **Three-Tier Model (Haiku/Sonnet/Opus)**
   - Rationale: Balance speed (Haiku), capability (Sonnet), expertise (Opus)
   - Enables cost-effective scaling and parallel execution

3. **Toss Tech Layer Mapping**
   - Commands → Controller layer (user interface)
   - Agents → Service layer (business logic)
   - Skills → Domain layer (core patterns)
   - Rationale: Clear separation of concerns, familiar structure for engineers

4. **Progressive Disclosure in Documentation**
   - README.md: Quick vision + start
   - CLAUDE.md: Detailed principles (developers)
   - rules/*.md: Specific workflow rules (agents)
   - Rationale: Different audiences, different depth needs

5. **Phase 1 Focus: Review Capabilities**
   - Rationale: Code review is universal pain point, foundation for future agents
   - Dependencies: Task learning (phase1-003) enables skill reuse

## Incomplete/TODO

- [ ] Implement phase1-001 (parallel review agents)
- [ ] Implement phase1-002 (triage workflow)
- [ ] Implement phase1-003 (review learning)
- [ ] Create phase2 backlog (estimated 3-5 tasks)
- [ ] Establish metrics/success criteria
- [ ] Setup CI/CD for release workflow

## Next Session Suggestions

1. **Start phase1-001**: Create parallel code review agents
   - Begin with file categorization agent (Haiku)
   - Then specialized review agents (Sonnet)
   - Orchestrate with Opus agent

2. **Refine backlog format**: If phase1 tasks reveal issues, update template and cascade to phase2

3. **Document patterns**: As agents are built, extract reusable patterns into skills/

4. **Setup metrics**: Define how to measure "code without reading" success
